About Me
===========

I am a software developer currently living in Seattle, Washington. I work for
[Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) where I build systems to 
automate the compute infrastructure that powers our cloud-computing services like
[EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and
[many more](http://aws.amazon.com/products/).

Projects I've worked on in my free time are listed on my [Projects](/projects.html/) page.
Also see my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/danielford/) for minor things too small
to list there.

[LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/danmford).
