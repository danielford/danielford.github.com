Projects
===============

Software projects I've either contributed to or worked on by myself in my own free time. I make no guarantees that
any of these still work :) Please see my [About](/about.html/) page for my professional experience.

### [Locrian](http://sourceforge.net/projects/locrian/)

A Rhythmbox-inspired frontend/client for the [Music Player Daemon](http://www.musicpd.org)
written in C++ using the [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/) GUI toolkit. This was my first
C++ project, as well as my first foray into real GUI programming (aside from Visual Basic).
